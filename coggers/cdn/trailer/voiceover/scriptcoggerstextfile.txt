The script idiots
Meet the Cogger’s *tf2 meet the team music plays*

Banon: what do you mean we don’t actually 100% complete games? If we didn’t complete games then we would not even be here!!!
Punctuation_: I mean, you are right I guess but we don’t do DLC so I mean kinda??
Banon: Oh, shut the actual fuck up. DLC is like a new game or like a spinoff and 100% is getting all achievements and it’s not like before you get the DLC you can see the DLC achievements if there even are any.
Punctuation_: Ok, well I guess I will agree with you on this one. I don’t want to do more work.
Banon: ‘’errm actually its not ‘’work’’ its play’’ I can see the nonexistant comments on this one, HARRY, BENJAMIN, EUGENE.
Punctuation_:Wait, is that Gabe?
Banon: comon not every dude wit-
Gabe: hi this is Gabe
Everyone: OOOHHH
Punctuation_: HOLY SHIT IT’S GABE
Gabe: And I'm really delighted to be part of this video. Because of our position in the indus-
Punctuation_: Anyways now that Gabe is gone lets finish the video.
Banon: LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE BECAUSE ONCE WE HIT 500 SUBSCRIBERS WE ARE COMPLETING TEAM FORTRESS 2
Punctuation_: Fucking Die. WAIT I MEAN! Scrap that. When we hit 500 subs we will complete tf2, 500 achievements for 500 subscribers.
Banon in the background: dude im so addicted to methamphetami
Punctuation_: Dude so relatable
