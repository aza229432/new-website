  "Ency_BlackHoleInstructions": "Singularity Containment Procedures",
  "EncyDesc_BlackHoleInstructions": "This alien document pertains to the operation of a microsingularity containment apparatus, and provides immense detail in regards to the function of such a device, both physically and technically. A brief summary of these functions is as follows:\n\nVacuum Assurance Field: through application of negative pressure and fluid barrier technology, a total vacuum can be created within the containment cage. This is necessary to prevent ambient gases from feeding the microsingularity, causing it to grow uncontrollably\n\nKugelblitz Emitters: a large array of photon emitters, the beams of which converge at the center of the device. When enough energy is concentrated in the center simultaneously, a microsingularity is formed.\n\nGraviton Counter-Field: This field prevents the vast majority of gravitational distortions from escaping the containment field. The few distortions that survive through this field are barely noticeable by living organisms, but can interfere with positioning systems in a range of a few hundred meters.\n\nChrono-Stasis Field: extremely similar to the field generated by the Stasis Rifle, this field slows time within its bounds to around 1 second for every 100,000 years outside the field. This prevents Hawking Radiation from dissipating the microsingularity within a microsecond, only requiring intermittent bursts of energy from the Kugelblitz emitters every few years. This process turns out to be several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than constantly sustaining the microsingularity with more energy.\n\nThere are details regarding how to manually disable any of the given functions of the containment apparatus, as well as a “shutdown mode” which uses the energy of the dissipating singularity to generate a wormhole inside of the machine to safely move it elsewhere. The proper procedure for shutting down this containment would be to activate shutdown mode, and then disable the Chrono-Stasis Field.",
